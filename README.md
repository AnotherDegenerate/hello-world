Hello

Another degenerate here. I see you've stumbled upon this thing. That's unfortunate for you. I'm interested in anime, manga, and really most things Japanese. Not that you needed to know that, just thought I'd let you know.
Manga and anime, I feel, are superior to western cartoons and comics, in many (but not all) cases.
